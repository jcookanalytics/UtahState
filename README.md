# UtahState Webscrapper

This currently produces two data frames and four visualizations
The main data frame breaks down play by play data from UtahStateAggies.com

To use on a different game change the url at the top of the script.  The variable is called siteurl.

Right now this has only been tested on a training dataset which is the Weber State game on September 1, 2016.
